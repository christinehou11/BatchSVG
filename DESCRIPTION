Description: `BatchSVG` is a feature-based Quality Control (QC) to identify 
    SVGs on spatial transcriptomics data with specific types of batch effect. 
    Regarding to the spatial transcriptomics data experients, the batch can be 
    defined as "sample", "sex", and etc.The `BatchSVG` method is based on 
    binomial deviance model (Townes et al, 2019) and applies cutoffs based on 
    the number of standard deviation (nSD) of relative change in deviance and 
    rank difference as the data-driven thresholding approach to detect the 
    batch-biased outliers.
