Description: `BiasDetect` is a feature-based Quality Control (QC) to identify 
    SVGs on spatial transcriptomics data with sometypes of batch effect. 
    Regarding to the spatial transcriptomics data experients, the batch can be 
    defined as "slide" or "subject".The `BiasDetect` method is based on 
    binomial deviance model (Townes et al, 2019) and applies cutoffs based on 
    the number of standard deviation (nSD) of deviance and rank difference as 
    the data-driven thresholding approach to detect the batch-biased features.
